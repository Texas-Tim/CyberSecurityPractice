## Disclaimer
I am a believer in learning with a teacher, as I've often been blocked while learning CyberSecurity because I don't know what I don't know, or how to look up information on topics that I'm not sure what terms to search for. This is why I'm posting a walkthrough to all the challenges I've solved. In each solution, the flags or final answers are hidden, but provided. I attempt to guide anyone who comes across this repository with my own thought process and introduction into terms and tools that are important to the challenge.

The intended manner to this walkthrough is to provide you with enough hints and information that you'll be able to then identify the rest of the steps on your own. I encourage you to limit the amount of information you look up in this guide and solve as much as you can without hints.

Feel free to use this as a guide to your own learning, if you need any additional hints, I'd suggest reaching out in the PirateSoftware `#HackThePlanet` discord channel where there are lots of folks on the same journey as you.
