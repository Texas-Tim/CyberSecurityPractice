CyberSecurity Practice Solutions


## Disclaimer
I am a believer in learning with a teacher, as I've often been blocked while learning CyberSecurity because I don't know what I don't know, or how to look up information on topics that I'm not sure what terms to search for. This is why I'm posting walk throughs to all the challenges I've solved. In each solution, the flags or final answers are hidden, but provided. I attempt to guide anyone who comes across this repository with my own thought process and introduction into terms and tools that are important to the challenge. 

Feel free to use this as a guide to your own learning, if you need a hint, I'd suggest reaching out in the PirateSoftware `#HackThePlanet` discord channel where there are lots of folks on the same journey as you.

EDIT: (I need to go back and hide solutions for Bandit and Natas which are currently shared as is)
