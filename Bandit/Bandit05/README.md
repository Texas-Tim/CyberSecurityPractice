# Bandit Level 5

### Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

### Commands you may need to solve this level
> ls , cd , cat , file , du , find

### Step by Step Walkthrough:
This is another one where the (-) shows up. Using the trick of ./<filename> allows you to run commands against the files. Unless you go through the trouble of writing a script, just use the "cat" command to find the pword. 

Using the "file" command shows that the true file uses ASCII text while the rest of the files use data. Just interesting
