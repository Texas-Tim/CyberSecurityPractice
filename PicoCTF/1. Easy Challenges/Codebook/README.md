## Learning - Codebooks
A `codebook` is a file or reference that contains a set of codes or values used for encoding or decoding information. In the context of your script, `codebook.txt` is used as a source of characters to generate a password, which is then used to decrypt the flag. The script reads specific characters from `codebook.txt` to build the password needed for the XOR decryption.
