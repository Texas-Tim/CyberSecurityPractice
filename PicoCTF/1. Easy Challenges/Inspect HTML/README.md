**Challenge Author:** LT 'syreal' Jones

### Description:

All good web page vulnerability inspections will generally comprise of two things:

1. Using the Web Page Inspector
2. Testing all the interactive elements

#### Step 2 - Action
lets start with opening up the web page inspector since we don't immediately see any interactive elements. For this challenge, that seems to be enough. Check out the `index` page of the `source` tab and grab the flag
