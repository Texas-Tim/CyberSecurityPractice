### Description: 
Can you get the flag?

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough:
Upon starting the instance, you are greeted by a website about a wikipedia article

#### Investigation - Web Page
All good web page vulnerability inspections will generally comprise of two things:

1. Using the Web Page Inspector
2. Testing all the interactive elements

lets start with opening up the web page inspector. For this challenge, that seems to be enough. If you peruse the .js and .css files you can find both parts of the flag. The button on the page even provides you a hint if you're not sure what to do.
